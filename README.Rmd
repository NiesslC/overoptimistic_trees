# overoptimistic_trees

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of overoptimistic_trees is to ...

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->
```{r , echo= FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(forcats)
library(purrr)
library(mlr3)
library(mlr3pipelines)
library(mlr3misc)
library(mlr3tuning)
library(paradox)
library(R6)
library(party) # for reemctree function
library(nlme) # for reemctree function
#library(rpart.plot)
```

```{r }

sessionInfo()
```

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub. -->
